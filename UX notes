// What is UX?

//   A life-cycle of research, strategy, design, and development. Goal is to find out user problems and resolve them, not necessarily use latest features.

// User Experience Research

//   Interview users to determine behaviors, i.e. the reason why they do something, what they find challenging about the process, what is most important to them in the scenario
//   Discover and Define what you are trying to solve
//   Create user personas or stories based on research, identify each persona's goal. Remove cruft.

// Why UX matters?

//   App users will not continue to use an app that is too much hassle, too many steps to get to feature they want
//   Enterprise software users need a functional, fluid, clean design to minimize mistakes. Good design saves money
//   Encompasses the entire customer experience, not just one piece of the process. Companies who spend on customer experience are thriving (Apple)
