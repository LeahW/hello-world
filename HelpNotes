// Get Help the Hacker Way: Notes from the #JavaScript IRC

// leahw, what i tell everyone when i'm introducing freenode is
// 1. stackoverflow/google  your problem first,
// 2. if you still can't find an answer create a simplified test case in jsfiddle if you can 
// 3. ask on #javascript with what the problem is, and the various attempts you've made
// you should let the rest of the class know those simple tricks.. 
// the simplified test case is the most important... 
// i.e. you reduce the problem down to the simplist example you can make
//   crazyhorse18
